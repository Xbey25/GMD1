### Player Experience and Game POV:

The player experience in "Dead End" is of immersive suspense and intense exploration. The game's point of view is from a first-person perspective, placing players directly into the  environment of the maze and allowing them to immerse themselves in the mystery and challenges it has.

### Visual and Audio Style:
Dark, atmospheric, and claustrophobic, with dimly lit corridors, ominous shadows, and unsettling environmental details. The maze itself is designed to evoke feelings of isolation and confusion onto the player as well as eary sound queues, that make the player aware of their movements (and perhaps of another).

### Game World Fiction:

In "Dead End" players awaken in a state of dizziness, finding themselves in an unfamiliar environment. They are trapped in a dark, empty hallway with no memory of who they are or how they arrived there. The only clue to their predicament is a ripped note lying nearby, bearing the message: "What have I done?"

Driven by a sense of urgency, panic, and fear, the player sets out to explore their surroundings. As they progress through the maze-like corridors, they encounter obstacles, traps, and cryptic messages hinting at a sinister purpose behind their predicament.

Throughout their journey, the player discovers remnants of an enigmatic experiment gone wrong, revealing pieces of a larger narrative involving secret research, ethical predicaments, and the results of meddling with forces beyond human understanding.
